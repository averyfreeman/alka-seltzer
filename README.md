Regardless of the person, most everyone requires a well designed site these days explaining who they are, what they do, and why you should be interested.

I'm not particularly excited about self-promotion, but I understand the necessity, so I've tried to embrace it as much as possible while making this site with some fun developer tricks that will hopefully keep me (and my intended audience) interested.

Note, some of these will still be in planning or implementation stages at the time of writing, but most this stuff is done. Feel free to clone and run locally, was developed `@ NodeJS 14.18.7

Attention given to ...
